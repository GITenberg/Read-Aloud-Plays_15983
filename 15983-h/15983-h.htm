<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The first two or three of these "plays" (I retain
the word for lack of a better one) began themselves
as short stories, but in each case I found that the
dramatic element, speech, tended to absorb the impersonal
element of comment and description, so that it
proved easier to go on by allowing the characters to
establish the situation themselves. As I grew conscious
of this tendency, I realized that even for the purpose
of reading it might be advantageous to render the
short story subject dramatically, since this method is,
after all, one of extreme realism, which should also
result in an increase of interest. As the series developed,
however, I perceived that something more than
a new short story form was involved; I perceived that
the "read-aloud" play has a distinct character and
function of its own. In the long run, everything human
rises or falls to the level of speech. The culminating
point, even of action the most poignant or emotion the
most intimate, is where it finds the right word or phrase
by which it is translated into the lives of others. Every
literary form has always paid, even though usually unconscious,
homage to the drama. But the drama as
achieved on the stage includes, for various reasons, only
a small portion of its own inherent possibility. Exigencies
of time and machinery, as well as the strong influence
of custom, deny to the stage the value of themes
such as the Divine Comedy, on the one hand, and of
situations which might be rendered by five or ten minutes'
dialogue on the other, each of which extremes may
be quite as "dramatic" as the piece ordinarily exploited
on the stage. By trying these "read-aloud" plays on
different groups, of from two to six persons, I have
proved that the homage all literature pays the drama
is misplaced if we identify the drama with the stage.
A sympathetic voice is all that is required to "get over"
any effect possible to speech; and what effect is not?
Moreover, by deliberately setting out for a drama independent
of the stage, a drama involving only the
intimate circle of studio or library, I feel that an entire
new range of experiences is opened up to literature itself.
Nothing is more thrilling than direct, self-revealing
speech; and, once the proper tone has been set,
even abstract subjects, as we all know, have the power
to absorb. Thus I entertain the hope that others will
take up the method of this book, the method of natural,
intimate, heart-to-heart dialogue carried on in a suitable
setting, and with attendant action as briefly indicated;
for the discovery awaits each one that speech,
independent of the tradition of the stage, has the power
of rendering old themes new and vital, as well as suggesting
new themes and situations. Indeed, it is in the
confidence that others will follow with "read-aloud"
plays far more interesting and valuable than the few
offered here that I am writing this introduction, and not
merely to call attention to a novelty in my own work.</p>

<p><i>Darkness. A door opens swiftly. Light from outside
shows a woman entering. She is covered by a large
cape, but the gleam of hair and brow indicates beauty.
She closes the door behind her. Darkness.</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Paul! Paul! Are you here, Paul?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">A Voice</span></p>

<p>Yes, Elizabeth, I am here.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Oh thank God! You are here! I felt so strange&mdash;I
thought ... Oh, I cannot tell you what I have
been thinking! Turn on the light, Paul.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>You are troubled, dear. Let the darkness stay a
moment. It will calm you. Sit down, Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Yes.... I am so faint! I <i>had</i> to come, Paul! I
had to <i>see</i> you, to know that you were.... I know
I promised not to, but I was going mad! Just to
touch you, to hold you ... but it's all right <i>now</i>.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>It is all right now, Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>I thought I could stand it, dear, I thought I could
stand it. It wasn't myself&mdash;I swear to you it wasn't&mdash;nor
<i>him</i>. I, I can stand all <i>that</i>, now. It was
something else, something that came over me all at
once. I saw&mdash;Oh Paul! the thing I saw! But it's
all right <i>now</i>....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>It is all right, Elizabeth, because ours is love, love
that is made of light, and not merely blind desire.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Ours is love. We <i>are</i> love!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>So that even if we are separated&mdash;even if you cannot
come to me yet, we shall not lose conviction nor
joy.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Yes, Paul. I will not make it harder for you. I
know it is hard, and that it was for my sake you
could bring yourself to bind me not to see you again.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>Love <i>is</i>, world without end. That is all we need to
know.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>World without end, amen.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>And because I knew the power and truth of love in
you I put this separation upon us.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>For my sake. I know it now, Paul! And trust me!
You <i>can</i> trust me, Paul! Not time, nor distance,
nor trouble nor change shall move me from the
heights of love where I dwell.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>And because I knew the happiness of love could not
endure in deceit, nor the wine give life if we drank it
in a cup that was stained, I put you from me&mdash;in the
world's sight we meet no more.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>In the world's sight ... and in the sight of God
and man shall I be faithful to him from now on, in
thought and deed and word, as a heart may be. Yes,
Paul ... even that can I endure for your sake.
For I know that hereafter&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>For love there is neither here nor hereafter, but the
realization of love is ever according to his triumph.
This has come to me suddenly, a light in the darkness,
and I have won the truth by supreme pain.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>That, too, Paul. <i>Pain</i>.... I have been weak. I
gave way to my nerves, but now in your presence I
am strong again, and I shall not fail you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>My presence is where your love is, and as your love
so my nearness. Love me as I love you now, and I
shall be more real to you than your hands and your
eyes.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p><i>Bone of one bone, and flesh of one flesh</i>....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>Spirit of one spirit! The flesh we have put away.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>That, too, Paul. Oh the glory of it! So be my
happiness that I shall not wish it changed, even before
the Throne!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Voice</span></p>

<p>I have given you happiness?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Woman</span></p>

<p>Perfect happiness, Paul. I am happy, happier than
I ever was before. But before I go home from here
for the last time, turn on the light, Paul, that we
may be to each other always as the wonder of this
moment. For the last time, Paul. Paul?... Paul?
Where are you? Why don't you answer?...
<i>Paul!</i> (<i>She turns on the light. It is a studio. At
the piano, fallen forward upon the keys, sits the
body of a man. There is a revolver on the floor beside
him.</i>) Paul!... <i>As I saw him!</i> Is <i>this</i> my
happiness. Oh God, <i>must</i> I?</p>

<p><i>The scene shows Uncle Richard's library, a massive
and expensive interior suggesting prosperity rather
than meditation. It is obviously new, and in the whole
room there is only one intimate and human note, a
quaint little oil painting of a boy with bright eyes&mdash;Uncle
Richard at the age of eleven.</i></p>

<p><i>Richard walks about, waiting for his uncle, and examines
the appointments with more curiosity than reverence.
Stopping by the mantle for a moment he notices,
with a start of surprise, his own photograph. He turns
away with a shrug just as his uncle hurriedly enters.</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Dick! Richard! At last! How are you? You received
my letter?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I am very well, uncle. Yes, I received your letter.
It was forwarded from Florence.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Good! Sit down, Richard, sit down.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I did not receive it until a few days ago, in New York.
I came on as soon as possible. But I had engagements&mdash;business
engagements&mdash;that delayed me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Business? I am very glad, Richard, that you have
given up your art. Not that art isn't entirely commendable,
but in times like these, you know....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Don't misunderstand me, uncle. My business was
connected with art. I haven't given up painting. I
never shall.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>In my letter&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes. Cousin Anne wrote me about Aunt Ethel's
death, but I did not realize how changed everything
here was until I read that letter from you. And now
(<i>glancing about</i>) it is even clearer. It must have
been a bitter shock to you, Uncle Richard. You
had both come to the point where you could have
done so much with life. But you are quite well, Uncle
Richard?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>I am never unwell. I don't believe in it. Yes, everything
was ready here. In its larger issue, my life
has not been unsuccessful.... But your business,
Richard, it came out well, I hope?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Quite. You see after graduating I borrowed a certain
sum to go abroad with a classmate. We had a
plan for doing a book on modern Italy, he writing
the text and I making illustrations. We had quite
a new idea about it all. It was good fun besides.
Well, the work has been placed, and now after repaying
the loan I have enough to take a studio and
begin painting in earnest.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Hum.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I believe I have a copy of one of the sketches with
me. (<i>He tears a sheet from a note book and hands
it to Uncle Richard.</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span> (<i>looking at it wrong side up</i>)</p>

<p>A sketch. I see. Of course it is unfinished?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes. But then, no painting should be what you call
"finished." A work of art can only be finished by
the mental effort of appreciation on the part of the
spectator. Photographs and chromos are <i>finished</i>&mdash;that's
why they are dead.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>I was not aware of the fact. But ... you will remember,
Richard, that in my letter I asked you to
visit me?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Of course. And I shall be very pleased to stay for
a few days. Very kind of you to ask me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Not at all, Richard, not at all! I&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>On Monday I must return to New York and look for
a studio. With the book coming out I feel I shall
have no trouble selling my work.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Studio? Isn't that&mdash;hem! rather <i>Bohemian</i>, Richard?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Good gracious, uncle, you haven't been reading
George Moore, have you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>But Richard, did you not understand that I wanted
you to stay here longer than that?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Why no. How long did you mean?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Er&mdash;I hadn't thought, exactly. I mean that I wanted
you to bring your things here&mdash;bring your things
here and just live on with me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I had no idea you meant <i>that</i>. Anyhow, as I couldn't
paint here, it's impossible. But, of course, if you
care to have me stay a few days longer&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>But I have everything arranged for you here. Your
room&mdash;everything.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>But you see, uncle, my work&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>I hope you will give up your art, but if you must
paint I will provide you a room for it. Do you know
how many rooms there are in this house, Richard?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Really, Uncle Richard, I thank you, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Don't mention it. And of course you can see to its
proper arrangement yourself.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I had no idea of this when I came and&mdash;but you see,
it's not only the studio an artist requires, it's atmosphere,
the atmosphere of enthusiasm and feeling.
You might as well give a business man a brand new
office equipment and turn him loose on the Sahara
desert as to shut a painter up in a town like this and
expect him to create. Artists need atmosphere just
as business men need banks. It's the meeting of like
forces that makes anything really go.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>But we are not wholly barbarous here, Richard. <i>This</i>,
for example, and no first-class New England city
lacks culture.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I suppose there's no use explaining, but what first-class
New England cities regard as <i>culture</i> your real
artist avoids as he would avoid poison.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Well, well. But circumstances&mdash;really, Richard,
don't you think it your <i>duty</i> to stay?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Must I explain? We are met, after a long separation,
in circumstances personally sorrowful to me,
and I trust, to some extent, to you as well. We....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes, a <i>long</i> separation.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>I admit, Richard, that from your point of view my
attitude has not always been as&mdash;as considerate, perhaps,
as you might have expected. But I have been
a very busy man, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, uncle, I have nothing to
blame you for; but my mother....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Your mother? Surely, Richard, your mother never
criticised me to you? She was much too fine a
woman. Besides, I helped her in many ways you
may know nothing about.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>No, mother said nothing. She wouldn't have, anyhow&mdash;and
as far as your helping her is concerned,
I can only judge of that by results.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Results? What do you mean? I have no desire to
catalogue the things I have done for one who was
near to me, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>That's all very well, uncle, and I have no criticism
to make. What's over is over. But when you speak
of my duty to you, I think of how mother died so
young, and how I found out afterward her affairs
were so difficult. I had no idea&mdash;she sacrificed herself
for me so long that I took it for granted. But
I think that you, as a business man, must have
known.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>You found that everything was mortgaged? Well,
Richard, it pains me to recall these things. Your
father, unfortunately, was a poor business man. As
for the mortgage, Richard, I held that myself.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>You did!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes. Even your mother did not know. I acted
through an agent, and the interest was two per cent.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>A nominal rate. Your mother was so proud&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Well, but there were other matters, long ago, that I
have only lately heard about. You and father once
started in business together....</p>


<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>We did. And I advised him to sell out when I did,
but he thought better to hold on.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Poor father. You made&mdash;he lost....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>But if he had followed my advice&mdash;. All this is painful
to me, Richard, and leads nowhere. As for yourself,
I have always been interested in you, more so
than you realize, and now&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Now?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>I cannot feel at fault for anything that has happened.
Your father was unsuited for modern life.
By the ordinary standards he was bound to fail.
Still, it gives me great satisfaction that at the present
time, Richard, I can offer you a home. Yes,
Richard, a <i>home</i>.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>It's difficult to decide.... You see, my studio&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Well! I confess I can't understand all this uncertainty!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>For three years I have worked as hard as anybody
could to make a position allowing me to paint. I
have succeeded. I no longer need help!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Of course not! I don't question your ability to get
along. At the same time, your attitude now is rather
quixotic. Besides, as far as your painting is concerned,
you can always go about where you require.
It isn't slavery I am planning for you here, Richard!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Well ... but then, as I must live by my sales and
commissions, I'd cut a poor figure in surroundings
like these.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Ha! Very quaint that, Richard, very quaint! I
suppose artists <i>are</i> like that.... Richard, I see
you do not yet understand. I shall be most happy
to provide for you in every way. Yes. I have considered
the whole matter carefully, and for some
time have only waited an opportunity to explain to
you in person. Consider, then, that you shall have
an income of your own. You see, Richard?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>No, I don't.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Why, it's simple enough!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes, the facts are, but I don't understand&mdash;an income,
a home. Why, I never dreamed of such a
thing!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>And why not, my boy, why not? We haven't seen
enough of each other, Richard. Perhaps I have been
at fault there, not to show more clearly the interest
I have always taken in you. Yes, indeed, a warm
interest, Richard!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Why not, Uncle Richard? Three years ago you
might have asked me that question. Now I ask you
<i>why</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Why? How strange! How could that question
arise between a man and his own nephew?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Three years ago, before Aunt Ethel died, I spent
Thanksgiving with you. It was during the recess,
my second year at Harvard. I came here practically
from my mother's funeral. I had just learned
the truth about our affairs&mdash;not a thing of ours
really ours, not a penny left. How mother had kept
the truth from me, I don't know. But suddenly
everything changed. The ground I had been standing
on gave way&mdash;my hands grasped everywhere for
support. I had never lacked, never thought about
money either way. I took it for granted that families
like ours were provided with a decent living by
some law of Providence.... I came here. I thought
of course you would help me. I didn't think so consciously&mdash;I
turned to you and Aunt Ethel from blind
instinct.</p>

<p>We spent Thanksgiving together. It was very
quiet, very sad. You both talked about mother and
the old days. At breakfast the next morning you
wished me good luck and went off to your office.
Afterward Aunt Ethel and I talked in the living room
while I waited for the train. She seemed ill at ease.
She alluded to your affairs once or twice, saying that
you were quite embarrassed by the state of politics,
and how sad it was that people couldn't do all they
wanted to in this world for others.</p>

<p>Uncle Richard, when Joseph came with the carriage,
Aunt Ethel kissed me, cried, and gave me&mdash;a twenty
dollar bill. Good God! and I thanked her for it.
Twenty dollars&mdash;carfare and a week's board! I left
the house completely dazed: it seemed like a bad
dream....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>There, there, Richard! We never imagined for a
moment. I thought your college course all provided
for&mdash;and your Aunt Ethel never understood business.
She doubtless exaggerated my difficulty. If
either of us had dreamed you were so worried! As
if I should have grudged you money!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>That's what I thought at first, and I hated you for
it, but afterward I realized it was not that&mdash;it was
worse.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p><i>Worse!</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes. It wasn't that you grudged the money, it was
that you simply didn't <i>think</i> of it. You felt that
something had to be done, because I made you feel
uncomfortable, but you didn't know exactly what,
and you were both relieved to see me go. I had
spoiled your Thanksgiving dinner&mdash;that was the
depth of your realization.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>No, no, Richard! You were so cold, so silent. You
made it impossible for us to help you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I suppose I did seem cold. That's the instinct of
inexperienced natures when they are desperate. But
it would have been so easy to break through with
one kind word or act.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>There, there! How glad I am that conditions are
changed!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Changed, yes, but it was I who changed them! The
shock of poverty was terrible at first, not because
I set too much value on money, nor because I was
unwilling to work, but because I felt I had no power
of attack. My nature was introspective, I lived in
an epic of my own creation. My strength and my
courage were wrapped up in dreams, and seemed to
have no relation to the practical world. I could have
faced the devil himself for an ideal, but to make my
own living&mdash;that was the nightmare!...</p>

<p>That was why I was so cold, so silent. If you had
said one human thing, straight from your heart to
mine, I should have been comforted. In a case like
that, as I now know, it is not money a man wants,
even if he himself thinks it is. No. It is just sympathy,
the right word that renews his courage and
arms him against the new circumstances by making
him feel he doesn't stand alone. If you had found
that word, or even tried to find it, I should have loved
you like a son. My heart was ready&mdash;you did not
want it!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>But you finished at college, Richard....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Yes, I finished. And do you know how? I spent that
first night all alone in my room, thinking. In the
morning I called on a classmate, a poor man who
was working his way. I said: "Here, I haven't a
cent. Advise me."</p>

<p>We talked it all over. He helped me sell my furniture,
he sublet my room. And he gave me a job.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>A&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>A job. Collecting and delivering laundry. That's
how I finished at college. I'm ashamed to admit it
now, but at first that work hurt me like a knife. I
couldn't see any relation between that and my ambition
for art. But it wore off. I grew tougher, I
learned the real meaning of things. And now I am
glad it happened.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Admirable, admirable! Really, Richard, I am more
than ever convinced that I have decided rightly.
Richard, you <i>must</i> make this your home!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Are you still talking about my <i>duty</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Richard, a man begins by working for himself alone,
then he works for the woman he marries, but even
that is not enough. One by one I have seen every
motive that ever impelled or guided me grow insufficient
and have to be replaced. Ambition and love,
once satisfied, point forward. We must always have
a future before us, Richard, unless we are willing to
become machines of habit. At one point or another
most men do become machines. Thank heaven, I never
could. In these last few months I have begun to
realize.... It was your Aunt Ethel's tragedy that
she had no children. I wonder now whether it is not
even more my own.</p>

<p><i>Richard, I have made you my heir.</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Your heir!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>My heir. And that is why, Richard&mdash;of course you
could not realize it at the time&mdash;that is why I allowed
myself to use the word "duty" as having reference to
the future if not to the past.</p>

<p>For the future, Richard, is ours to enjoy, without
misunderstanding, without disharmony, I at the end
of my labours, you at the beginning of yours. You
have revealed qualities I confess I had not suspected,
qualities fitting you for responsibility and administration.
With the position you will henceforth occupy,
Richard, you should enter public life. Nothing
more honorable for a responsible citizen.... Nothing
more essential to the welfare of our beloved republic
at its present critical state. We need the English
tradition over here, Richard&mdash;solid, responsible
men to administer public affairs. I have often felt
the need of an efficient aristocracy in our social and
industrial life. And nothing would please me more
than to see you rise to authority by the leverage of
my wealth. Nothing would please me more&mdash;why,
Richard, I should consider it the prolongation of my
own life!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>No. No you don't, Uncle Richard. Never!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>What on earth do you mean?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I won't be your heir!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Wh&mdash;what? Good heavens! Are you <i>mad</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I hope so. Yes, I hope that from your point of view
I am quite mad. You won't understand me, because
you don't understand what I most love and what I
most hate. Oh you self-made Americans! When I
really needed your helping hand you didn't think of
me. You had the American idea that every tub must
stand on its own bottom, that every young fellow
must make <i>good</i>&mdash;that is, make money. You buy
"art" at a certain stage in your development just as
you buy motor cars, and you think you can buy
artists the same way. You don't know that to buy
dead art is to starve live artists.</p>

<p>Well, I made good. I can stand alone. Are you
offering me money now to help me in my work? Not
a bit! Rich men haven't changed since the first
tribal chief ordered his bow and arrows, his wives
and servants, to be buried with him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>You conceited young rascal! I needn't leave you a
cent!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I haven't asked you to. I never thought about your
money. I can get along very well without it. But
can you take it with you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Of course not! But I can leave it to whom I please.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Why don't you leave it to Joseph?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>To Joseph&mdash;my coachman? Are you joking?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Not at all. Didn't he save your life in the Civil War?
And what have I ever done for you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>I have remembered Joseph very handsomely, but to
make him my <i>heir</i>&mdash;why, that isn't the same thing at
all!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Well, to a university then?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>A church?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>No!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>A cat hospital?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Damn cats! There's been enough of them sick in my
own house!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Well, I give it up.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>You young fool! You don't know what you are saying!
<i>Joseph! Church! Cat Hospital!</i> What good
would I get out of that? Is that what I have been
working for all my life? No indeed!</p>

<p><i>Richard, you shall be my heir!</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>I won't! You are only interested in me because I
bear your name. If I were John Smith, though ten
times the better man, you would never waste a
thought upon me. My name is an accident&mdash;I care
nothing for that. My real self is my art, for which
you care even less. All you want is to establish a
dynasty&mdash;the last infirmity of successful men.</p>

<p>No, I won't be your heir!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Madness, madness! What kind of a world are we
coming to?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Listen. One day when I was walking outside Siena
I came to a fine old villa with a wonderful garden.
A row of cypresses ran along the wall inside, and
I wanted to paint it. The gardener let me in for a
tip. While I sat there working, he watching me&mdash;even
the peasants have a feeling for paint over there&mdash;we
heard a tap on the window. It was the
padrona. I saw that she wanted to speak to me, and
I went in. She was an old, crippled woman, holding
to life by sheer will, sitting all day by the fire
in one room. She spoke French, so we could talk.
To my surprise she was very much interested in me&mdash;asked
questions about my work, my family, and so
on. I couldn't understand why. But when I left
she began crying and told me that I reminded her
of her grandson who had been killed in Tripoli, and
that there was no one of the family name left, but
that she had to leave the property either to a cousin
whom she detested, or to the Church. And she said
just what you have: that this wasn't the <i>same thing</i>.
She had nothing to live for, she said, now the heir was
dead, except keep the place out of others' hands.
There she was, a prisoner in that beautiful villa, enjoying
nothing, where an artist would have been in
paradise. I see her yet, bent over the fire in a black
lace shawl, crying.</p>

<p>On my way back to town I happened to think of my
last visit with you, and my state of mind returned,
my feeling of dependence and the gloomy Thanksgiving
dinner. The shock of contrast between my
old and my new self stopped me short in the road.
In a flash I saw the lying materialism on which the
world is based, the curse of dollar worship that keeps
opportunity away from the young, at the same time
it keeps the old in a prison of loneliness and suspicion.
If we worshipped life instead of metal disks,
we would see that the young are not really the heirs
of the old, but the old are heirs of the young. Then
and there I vowed to keep myself clear of the whole
wretched tangle, even if I had to carry laundry all
my life, so that if any one ever tried to fetter me
I could fling his words back in his face! (<i>Uncle
Richard's nerves are all on edge. A terrific storm
of overbearing temper visibly gathers during this
speech, and the Colonel's long habit of successful
domination seems about to assert itself in an explosion.
But at the last moment another power, deeper
than habit, older than character, represses his wrath,
and when Uncle Richard speaks again it is with an
earnest gentleness almost plaintive.</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Richard, for heaven's sake let us stop this quarreling!
Let us forget what has been said and done on
both sides and begin anew. I offer you a home here
during my life time, and all that I own after I am
dead. I <i>do</i> care for you, my boy, I know it now as
I know my own name. Surely, Richard, you need
not take this offer amiss?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Well, but you see, Uncle Richard....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Do you prefer poverty for its own sake?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Of course not. But I prefer it to hypocrisy and
compromise.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Well then. You will accept, Richard? For my sake,
Richard?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Well....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>It is the only pleasure left to me, Richard, thinking
of the old name going down honourably in you. And
as for the past, my mistakes were due to not having
a son of my own. You have no idea what a difference
it makes. It's my dream, Richard, don't destroy
it!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>If you really mean it that way&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>My dear Richard! My dear boy! Why&mdash;now I
know why we have been quarreling, Richard!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Because we are so much alike. At your age I was
the same self-willed beggar you are. Richard, you are
more like me than you are like your own father!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Richard</span></p>

<p>Le roi est morte, vive le roi. <i>But</i> (<i>and he thumps
the table with great emphasis</i>) but there's one thing
understood&mdash;I'm going to paint <i>masterpieces</i>!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Uncle Richard</span></p>

<p>Of course you are, my boy, of course you are! In
fact, I always <i>knew</i> you would, Richard!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Well, only I don't want to have you flop all of a sudden,
like <i>he</i> did. What'll you have, a cocktail?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Let's see.... What's the matter, Marian?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Sh! Don't turn round!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>What's up?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p><i>Him!</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Him who?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p><i>George!</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Good Lord! Well, don't mind <i>him</i>. He hasn't got
anything on you now. You're <i>mine</i>.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Sure I am. He isn't looking. He's with a woman.
By jingo! It's that millinery kid!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>What millinery kid? Besides, what difference does
it make? Let him have a hundred, if he wants 'em.
<i>We're</i> happy.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>The nerve of him! I knew it was her right along.
He tried to throw a bluff it was some swell. I'll bet
he paid good for those clothes!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Oh, come on! What'll you have? Besides, she might
have made the clothes herself.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Made 'em herself! Say, a fine lot you know about
ladies' gowns! That came from the Avenue, straight.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Well, what if it did? I'll get you a better one, you
just wait.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Sh! He's looking over here!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Hm! Look at me and you won't see him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>The nerve!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>What's he done?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>He smiled right over like nothing had ever happened.
I'll bet he's going to say something mean about me.
Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Let's change our seats. I'm hungry!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Change nothing! Catch me giving him a laugh like
that! I could tell her things, the young&mdash;There,
now <i>she's</i> looking!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>What if she is? Say, look here&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>He's getting up! Well, of all the brass!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>He's coming over here!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>He is! Don't you say a word. I'll take <i>him</i> on!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>If he dares&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Hello, Marian!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Hm!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>What, got a grouch on your honeymoon? That's a
bad sign, Marian!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>No, I haven't got any grouch! Don't <i>you</i> worry!
You're the only grouch I ever had, thank the Lord!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Well then. It isn't every woman gets rid of an incompatible
husband and gets hold of a compatible
one, all in same season.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Look here!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>That's just like him! Coming over here with a grin
on like a kid with a new toy. Well, we don't want
anything to do with <i>you</i>. See?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Sure. Excuse me for butting in. I just wanted to
make a little announcement.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Oh, you did! Well, I'm surprised! I didn't think
<i>she</i> was the kind you had to marry.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Huh! I knew you'd have your little knife out for
her. But why you should have to be jealous <i>now</i> I
can't see.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>I'm not jealous!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>What you worrying about, then?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>I'm not worrying! I'm only sore because you butted
in when we were so happy together here without you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Oh, <i>excuse</i> me! As a matter of fact, I didn't come
over to make any announcement. It's too late for
that. I&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Married already! Anybody'd think you might wait
a little while for common decency!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>I waited a day longer than you did, anyhow.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>That's different.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>I <i>beg</i> your pardon! We were just ordering dinner.
If you didn't come to make any announcement, why&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Yes, what did you butt in for?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Why, I got a letter from your friend Grace, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Grace? What did she have to say to <i>you</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>She said she was sorry I had to get a divorce, but I
told her&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Sorry <i>you</i> had to get a divorce! Well, if I don't fix
<i>her</i>!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Oh, she's getting married, too.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Who to?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>That fellow, what's his name, that's got the garage
over on Seventh Avenue.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Snider! So <i>he's</i> the one! Well! And I suppose
she'll be all over town in a new car.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Sure. Saw him to-day. A big yellow one. I always
told you she was out for money. And you thought
she was in love with Jackson!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Hypocrite! She was. Or she told me so. Cried all
over me. Have you seen Jackson?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">George</span></p>

<p>Yes. He's as blue as your old kimono. He said&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Fred</span></p>

<p>Look here, Marian! I'm not going to wait all night
for my dinner!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Marian</span></p>

<p>Order your old dinner! What did Jackson say,
George?</p>

Stone flags lead to the road; the yard is a careless,

It is autumn.</i></p>

<p><i>A boy of sixteen or so, carrying a paper parcel, stops
hesitatingly, looks in a moment and then walks to the

house. The man is in his early forties, he stoops a little,

<p>I wonder if you have seen my dog? I was going for
a walk, but Rex seems to have grown tired of waiting.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Your dog? No, sir, I haven't seen him. Shall I
go look?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>No, never mind. He'll come back. Rex and I understand
each other. He has his little moods, like
me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>If you were going for a walk&mdash;?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>It doesn't matter at all. I can go any time. You
don't live in this country?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>No, sir. I live in New York. I wish I did. It's
beautiful here, isn't it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>It's very beautiful to me. I love it. You may have
come a long road this morning, let's sit down.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Thank you. I'm not interfering with anything?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Bless your heart! No indeed. What is there to interfere
with? All we have is life, and this is part of
it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I like to sit under these trees. It makes me think of
the Old Testament.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>That's interesting. How?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Well, maybe I'm wrong, but whenever I think of the
Old Testament I see an old man under a tree&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>A man who has lived it all through, you know, and
found out something real about it; and he sits there
calm and strong, something like a tree himself; and
every once in a while somebody comes along&mdash;a boy,
you know,&mdash;and the boy talks to him all about himself,
just as we imagine we'd like to with our fathers,
if they weren't so busy, or our teachers, if they
didn't depend so much upon books, or our ministers,
if we thought they would really understand,&mdash;and
the old man doesn't say much maybe, but the boy
goes away much stronger and happier....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, I understand. The Old Testament....
They <i>did</i> get hold of things, didn't they?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>What I can't understand is how nowadays people
seem more grown up and competent than those men
were, in a way, and we do such wonderful things&mdash;skyscrapers
and aeroplanes&mdash;and yet we aren't half
so wonderful as they were in the Old Testament with
their jugs and their wooden plows. I mean, we aren't
near so big as the things we do, while those old fellows
were so much bigger. We smile at them, but
if some day one of our machines fell over on us what
would we do about it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I went through a big factory just last week. One
of my friends' father is the manager, and all I could
think of was what could a fellow do who didn't like
it, who didn't fit in.... Nowadays most everybody
seems competent about factories or business or something
like that&mdash;you know&mdash;and they've got hold of
everything, so a fellow's got to do the same thing
or where is he?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>That's the first question, certainly: where is he? But
where is he if he does do the same thing?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Why, he's with the rest. And <i>they</i> don't ask that
question....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid they don't. It would be interesting to be
there if they should begin to ask it, wouldn't it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Yes.... I'd like to be there when some <i>I</i> know ask
themselves! But they never will. Why should they?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Don't you mean how <i>can</i> they?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Yes, of course. They don't ask the question because
the big thing they are doing seems to be the answer
beforehand. But it isn't! Not compared with the
Old Testament. So we have to ask it for ourselves.
And that's why I came here....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Oh. You want to know where <i>they</i> are, with their
power, or where <i>you</i> will be without it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Where I'll be. I hate it! But what else is there to-day?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Why, there's you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>But that's just it! What am I for if I can't join
in? I came to you.... You don't mind my talking,
do you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>On the contrary.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Well, everybody I know is a part of it, so how could
they tell me what to do outside of it? I've been
wondering about that for a year. Before then, when
I was just a boy, the world seemed full of everything,
but now it seems to have only one thing. That
or nothing. Then one day I saw a photograph somebody
had cut out of a Sunday paper, and I thought
to myself there's a man who seems outside, entirely
outside, and yet he has something. It wasn't all or
nothing for him ... and I wondered who it was.
Then I found your book, with the same picture in it.
You bet I read it right off! It was the first time in
my life I had ever felt power as great as skyscrapers
and railroads and yet apart from them. Outside of
all they mean. Like the Old Testament. Those
poems!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>You liked them?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>It was more than that. How can a fellow <i>like</i> the
ocean, or a snow storm?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Is that what you thought they were like?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Why, they went off like a fourteen inch gun! Not
a whine about life in them&mdash;not a single regret for
anything. They were wonderful! They seemed to
pick up mountains and cities and toss them all about
like toys. They made me feel that what I was looking
for was able to conquer what I didn't like....
I said to myself I don't care if he does laugh at me,
I'll go and ask him where all that power is! And
so I came....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>There's Rex now&mdash;over across the road. He's wondering
who you are. He sees we are friends, and
he's pretending to be jealous. Dogs are funny,
aren't they? But you were speaking about my poems.
It's odd that their first criticism should come from
you like this. You must be about the same age I
was when I began writing&mdash;when I wanted above
anything to write a book like that, and when such a
book seemed the most impossible thing I could do.
Like trying to swim the Atlantic, or live forever.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>It seemed impossible? I should think it would be the
most natural thing in the world, for <i>you</i>&mdash;like eating
dinner.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>That's the wonderful thing&mdash;not the book, but that
<i>I</i> should have come to write it!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>But who else could write it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>At your age I thought anybody could&mdash;anybody and
everybody except myself.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Really and truly. You've no idea what a useless
misfit I was.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>But I read somewhere you had always been brilliant,
even as a boy.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately ... yes. That was what made it so
hard for me. Shall I tell you about it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I wish you would!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Brilliance&mdash;I'll tell you what that was, at least for
me. I wrote several things that people called "brilliant."
One in particular, a little play of decadent
epigram. It was acted by amateurs before an admiring
"select" audience. That was when I was
twenty-one. From about sixteen on I had been
acutely miserable&mdash;physically miserable. I never
knew when I wouldn't actually cave in. I felt like a
bankrupt living on borrowed money. Of course, it's
plain enough now&mdash;the revolt of starved nerves. I
cared only for my mind, grew only in that, and the
rest of me withered up like a stalk in dry soil. So
the flower drooped too&mdash;in decadent epigram. But
nobody pointed out the truth of it all to me, and I
scorned to give my body a thought. People predicted
a brilliant future&mdash;for me, crying inside! Then
I married. I married the girl who had taken the
star part in the play. According to the logic of the
situation, it was inevitable. Everybody remarked
how inevitable it was. A decorative girl, you know.
She wanted to be the wife of a great man.... Well,
we didn't get along. There was an honest streak in
me somewhere which hated deception. I couldn't
play the part of "brilliant" young poet with any
success. She was at me all the while to write more
of the same thing. And I didn't want to. The difference
between the "great" man I was supposed to
be and the sick child I really was, began to torture.
I knew I oughtn't to go on any further if I wanted
to do anything real. Then one night we had an
"artistic" dinner. My wife had gotten hold of a famous
English poet, and through him a publisher. The
publisher was her real game. I drank champagne before
dinner so as to be "brilliant." I was. And before
I realized it, Norah had secured a promise from the
publisher to bring out a book of plays. I remember
she said it was practically finished. But it wasn't,
only the one, and I hated that. But I sat down conscientiously
to write the book that she, and apparently
all the world that counted, expected me to
write. Well, I couldn't write it. Not a blessed word!
Something inside me refused to work. And there I
was. In a month or so she began to ask about it.
Norah thought I ought to turn them out while she
waited. I walked up and down the park one afternoon
wondering what to tell her.... And when I
realized that either she would never understand or
would despise me, I grew desperate. I wrote her a
note, full of fine phrases about "incompatibility,"
her "unapproachable ideals," the "soul's need of freedom"&mdash;things
she <i>would</i> understand and wear a
heroic attitude about&mdash;and fled. I came here....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Of course. But didn't she follow you? Didn't they
bother you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Not a bit. Norah preferred her lonely heroism. In
a few months I was quite forgotten. That was one
of the healthful things I learned. Well, I was a
wreck when I came here, I wanted only to lie down
under a tree.... And there it was, under that tree
yonder, my salvation came.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Your salvation?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Hunger. That was my salvation. Simple, elemental,
unescapable appetite. You see I had no servant,
no one at all. So I had to get up and work
to prepare my food.... It was very strange.
Compared with this life, my life before had been like
living in a locked box. Some one to do everything
for me except think, and consequently I thought too
much. But here the very fact of life was brought
home to me. I spent weeks working about the house
and grounds on the common necessities. By the time
winter came on the place was fit to live in&mdash;and I
was enjoying life. All the "brilliance" had faded
away; I was as simple as a blade of grass.</p>

<p>For a year I didn't write a word. I had the courage
to wait for the real thing, nobody pestering me to
be a "genius"! Some day you may read that first
book. People said I had re-discovered the virtue of
humility. I had.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I will read it! And how much more it will mean to
me now!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>I suppose you know the theory about vibrations&mdash;how
if a little push is given a bridge, and repeated
often enough at the right intervals, the bridge will
fall?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Well, that's the whole secret of what you have been
looking for&mdash;what you found in my poems.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I don't understand.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>A man's life is a rhythm. Eating, sleeping, working,
playing, loving, thinking&mdash;everything. And
when we live so that each activity comes at the right
interval, we gain power. When one interrupts another,
we lose. Weakness is merely the thrust of one
impulse against another, instead of their combined
thrust against the world. When I came here, feeling
like a criminal, I was obeying the one right instinct
in a welter of emotions. It was like the faintest of
heart beats in a sick body. I listened to that. Then
I learned physical hunger, then sleep, and so on.
It's incredible how stupid I was about the elemental
art of living! I had to begin all over from the beginning,
as if no one had ever lived before.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>That's what you meant in your poems about religion.</p>

<p>Exactly! I learned that "good" is the rhythm of
the man's personal nature, and that "evil" is merely
the confusion of the same impulses. As time went
on it became instinctive to live for and by the rhythm.
Everything about my life here was caught up and
used in the vision of power&mdash;drawing water, cutting
wood, digging in the garden, dawn. It was all marvelous&mdash;I
couldn't help writing those poems. They
are the natural joys and sorrows of ten years. As a
matter of fact, though, I grew to care less and less
about writing, as living became fuller and richer.
People write too much. They would write less if
they had to make the fire in the morning.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>The first impulse ... I see. Oh, life might be so
simple!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Why not? The animals have it. Men have it at
times, but we make each other forget. If we could
only be each other's reminders instead of forgetters!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Yes! But I see the only thing to do is to go away,
like you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Not necessarily, I was merely a bad case, and required
a desperate remedy, earth and air and freedom
from others' will. I need the country, but the
next man might require the city as passionately.
Don't imagine that only the hermits, like me, live
instinctively. It can be done in New York, too, only
one mustn't be so sensitive to others.... After all,
friend, we were wrong in saying that this power lies
outside the world of skyscrapers and business. It
doesn't lie outside nor inside. It cuts across everything.
Do you see? For it's all a matter of the
man's own soul.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Then?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>We can't live in a vacuum. The more you feel the
force, the more you must act. The more you can
act. And in the long run it doesn't matter what you
do, if you do what your own instinct bids.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Then I <i>could</i> stay right in the midst of it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Yes. And if you were thinking of writing poetry,
it might even be better to stay in the midst of it.
Drama, you know ... and it's time for a new
drama.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>It isn't that, with me. I can't write.... I had one
splendid teacher. He used to talk about things
right in class. He said that most educated people
think that intellect is a matter of making fine
distinctions&mdash;of seeing as two separate points what the
unintelligent would believe was one point; but that
this idea was <i>finicky</i>. He wanted us to see that intelligence
might also be a matter of seeing the connection
between two things so far apart that most
people would think they were always separate. I
like that. It made education <i>mean</i> something, because
it made it depend on imagination instead of
grubbing. And then he told us about the history of
our subject&mdash;grammar. How it began as poetry, when
every word was an original creation; and then became
philosophy, as people had to arrange speech
with thought; and then science, with more or less
exact, laws. I could <i>see</i> it&mdash;the thing became alive.
And he said all knowledge passed through the same
stages, and there isn't anything that can't eventually
be made scientific. That made me think a good deal.
I wondered if somebody couldn't work out a way of
preventing anybody from being poor. It seems so
unnecessary, with so much work being done. That's
what I want to do. Thanks to you, I&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Here's Rex! Rex, know my good friend. I know you
will like him. Rex always cares for the people I do,
don't you, Rex?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Of course, I see one thing: it's the people nearest
one that make the most difference. Mother, now, she
will understand.... You don't believe in marrying,
though, do you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>I certainly do!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>But I thought&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>You thought because I left one woman and hadn't
found another that I didn't care for women? Others
believe that, too, but it isn't so. On the contrary.
You see, I didn't so much leave her as get away from
my own failure. Of course, there is such a thing as
the wrong woman. She makes a man a fraction.
The better she is in herself, the less she leaves him
to live by. One twentieth is less than one half. But
the right woman! She multiplies a man....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Why, you might have told from my poems how I
believe in love.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I don't remember any love poems.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Bless your heart! Every one of them was a love
poem. Not the old-fashioned kind, about fading
roses and tender hearts.... I sent that book out
as a cry for the mate. It is charged with the fulness
of love. That's why I could write about trees and
storms.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I suppose if I had been older....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>It isn't one's age but one's need. <i>She</i> will understand.
Look, the sun has gone round the corner of
the house. Is that lunch you have in the parcel?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>Would you like to make it a picnic? I'll get something
from the house, and then we can walk to the
woods.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Boy</span></p>

<p>I'd love to!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">The Man</span></p>

<p>All right, I'll be ready in no time. Come, Rex!</p>

<p><i>A young woman enters the garden from the lawn

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Look here, Roger, you can't keep this up!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>No, I can't keep this up. Besides, it's going to rain
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Watering the plants. Isn't that what you meant?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>You aren't watering the plants. I've been watching
you for half an hour. If you only would! But you
keep forgetting what you are at.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I wish it were only forgetting&mdash;it's remembering.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh Roger, don't I know? But you mustn't!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I suppose not. I suppose not.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I knew all along, and I kept away. How you felt, I
mean. I ought to have come over a week ago. You
haven't anybody to talk to&mdash;that's the trouble,
Roger, really. I know. Now let's have the whole
thing out. Come. And don't be afraid of me. Why,
I could tie you all up in bandages if you needed it.
And not flinch.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes, I guess you could.... It's, it's absurd how
well I keep!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Hm. Isn't it? You ought to be wilting away like a
rose. But no, you keep your splendid strength and
go on with two or three men's work! What would
your mother think if she heard you talking like that?
Don't you know that you couldn't please her better
than by going on as you are?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>That's so. Of course. But that really isn't what I
was thinking of. I was thinking how queer this whole
business is. Take our family. As far back as I
know we were always struggling along with many
children and few means. I am the first one who could
really make money. And just when I could make
mother comfortable and easy ... besides, I'm all
alone.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Ah, Roger, of course you feel that way! But you
don't really appreciate that wonderful mother of
yours. Do you think her happiness depended on
having a new house, and a car?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>No....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Didn't she round out her life beautifully? Wasn't
she repaid for her struggles by seeing you succeed?
Didn't she pass away as quietly as going to sleep?
And wasn't her marriage happy? You don't know
how much a woman will meet with, if she's happy!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>That part of it I can face all right, though I suppose
it's hard for the ordinary selfish man to realize
that love like mother's is its own reward. But toward
the end she suffered&mdash;she worried....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I know she did. She told me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>She told you? I didn't know that.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>We were good friends, your mother and I&mdash;and
women. That's why she told me. And I think I
reassured her.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Oh! She did seem to get mightily comforted, just at
the last. I never understood why.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I thank heaven I really did that!&mdash;And when I looked
out the window and saw you standing here, I had
to come over. I knew it wasn't your mother's death
that was hurting you, but&mdash;but your brother's.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Arthur ... I'm glad the accident happened after
<i>she</i> died.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes. But there's something else. Something that
hurts. You've got to tell me. Everything. Don't
be afraid. Face it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I have faced it. I&mdash;I've made up my mind.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>There's still pain somewhere. Is it in the way you
have made up your mind?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>How could that be?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>It depends. But tell me what you thought&mdash;I mean
during this last year or so. It didn't come to you
all at once.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Well.... Of course, I always took it for granted
about his music. He seemed to be wonderful at that.
And mother believed so in him. It really began when
he left college, I found he had debts.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Debts?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes. Not just clothes and living&mdash;other things. I
paid up, but I didn't like it. I didn't like the things.
But I thought it was just a boy's foolishness. I
thought he would be all right after that, but&mdash;he
wasn't.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>He wasn't....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>No. After a couple of years I had to straighten it
out again. I came down on him flat. He promised
to cut it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But he was doing such wonderful work!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes, everybody began to say so. If he had only been
that alone, the musician! But&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But afterward?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Well, a year ago I began to hear things said again.
And then I found letters and bills. It was the same
thing all over. He hadn't kept his word.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But what did <i>he</i> say?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I let it go for weeks, hoping he would say something.
But never a word.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>He loved you so. How he must have suffered!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes, I suppose he did suffer. But if he cared so for
me why did he try to keep it hidden, the one thing
I would hate most?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>That was his way. It made him ashamed.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Well, he couldn't keep it dark forever. Mother almost
found out.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Almost found out?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes. So of course I stepped in. We had a frightful
row.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>When was that?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Six months ago. I got him clear. It was hard&mdash;this
time the woman almost got him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I helped him. But I did it on one condition&mdash;that
he go to work.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Work? What about his music?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>That's what he said. But I asked him if he had
thought about his music when he got into these
scrapes. He couldn't say a word. So it was all arranged
for him to go into my office, right under my
eye, when mother was taken sick. Then she wanted
him to stay near her, so.... And then she died.
And the accident. Well I don't see what more I
could have done.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No.... Of course, it wasn't as if you turned
against him. And the office&mdash;he was to pay you
back that way?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Pay me back? Why, if he could, naturally; but that
wasn't my idea, that was only incidental. My idea
was to get him into the habit of hard work.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But he always <i>did</i> work!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Oh, he worked hard enough. At least he turned out
a good deal. But that was spasmodic&mdash;night and
day for weeks, and then loafing for weeks more.
That's how he always got into trouble: loafing in
between.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Don't you remember how splendid he was the day
he had just finished something? He seemed to have
passed out of himself into a shining humility. It
was said of Shelley: <i>"Sun-treader!"</i>... Don't you
remember?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes.... Oh hang it! Why couldn't he have been
only that! Yes, I remember. I hoped that six
months or so at the office&mdash;but no. Anyhow, it's all
over now.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>What were you going to say?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I suppose I might as well say it: I don't believe the
office would have changed him, after all. That is,
permanently. He'd have done his best for a while,
and then&mdash;. No, nothing could help him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Is that what you have made up your mind about?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Oh, that. Yes, that's what started me thinking.
Everybody has difficulties, troubles, and I believe in
helping a fellow every time. Life piles up too high
against one sometimes, but a little shove from the
other side will move it away. I never believed in the
devil take the hindmost, at all. But this was different.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Different, how? What do you mean?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I mean that as long as a fellow's difficulties are outside
him you can help him, because as soon as they
are removed he's himself again; but when they are
inside, part of the man himself, there's nothing you
can do. Nothing. You can save a person from the
world, but not from himself. That's where the devil
comes in. I see it now. I believe in the devil.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh! But <i>Arthur</i>....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I know you think I'm a brute for speaking of Arthur
in connection with the devil, but it wasn't the old-fashioned
devil I meant. I meant the devil of unfitness.
Arthur wasn't <i>fit</i>. He had every chance. We
can't get away from what life is. Life shoves people
to the wall every day. I've had to fight hard myself.
I admit things aren't fair all round, but Arthur
had his chance, two or three chances, and he just&mdash;dropped
out. He couldn't <i>survive</i>. And it seems
to me that for those who loved him it may be a good
thing after all that he didn't have to go on.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Roger! You shan't say that! You shan't!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I don't want to, Margaret, but that's what life itself
says. We can't get behind life. We can't beat evolution
and the law of survival.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But his talent, his fine talent&mdash;and his exquisite
nature!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I know. But there it is. It's kinder in the long run
to be cruel, if the truth is cruel. We've got to be
true to things as they are.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>But take things as they are! He wasn't vicious
about&mdash;about women, he was like a child. Of course
they got his money, but even so, they weren't all mere
schemers. Some of them were very decent. Why,
one of them&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>What the deuce do <i>you</i> know about them? What
about one of them?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>She cried. She said she knew it wasn't right, that
he couldn't marry her, but she did like him, and she
had children of her own.... I'm sure she was very
tender to him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Who told you? Where did you see her?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p><i>There.</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>There! In my own house?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>How did <i>she</i> get there?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Your mother sent for her.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>My mother sent for her? Then she knew?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes. She knew everything.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>How?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p><i>He</i> told her&mdash;Arthur did.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Good Lord! I never heard a word of it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No. They were afraid&mdash;afraid you wouldn't understand.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Afraid <i>I</i> wouldn't understand? Why, <i>I</i> understood
only too well. It was mother that wouldn't have understood.
I'd have cut my hand off rather than tell
her.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Well, she did understand. She understood better
than you did. She understood that part of him
hadn't grown up. He was like a boy. He just walked
into things....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>How did he ever come to tell <i>her</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Once when he was sick. Your mother was taking
care of him. He blurted it all out, like a homesick
boy.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>And <i>she</i> understood? Didn't break her heart, and all
that?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, it was a shock, naturally. But they talked it
all over, and your mother sent for this woman. I
knew. Arthur knew I knew....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>And mother packed her away without telling me?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, she didn't pack her away. That is, right off.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>He kept on seeing her? With mother's knowledge?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes. Your mother liked her.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Well, if women aren't the strangest things!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes, they are. Some of them. Fortunately. But
you see how wrong you were, Roger?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>How was I wrong?</p>

<p>About this unfitness&mdash;this survival.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>On the contrary. It only proves it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>No, it doesn't. I've been thinking, too ... about
saving people from themselves, and all that. You
say it's the law of life, and we can't go beyond life.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>No, we can't. I still say it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Then what about your mother? What about all
women who&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>About mother?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes. Wasn't her love a part of life? And didn't she
keep on loving him in spite of everything? Is that
love blind and foolish&mdash;something for your old evolution
to get rid of?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>I never thought of it. No, of course we don't want
to get rid of <i>that</i>&mdash;but even so, she didn't save him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>She didn't know about it until lately&mdash;thanks to you.
If she had known sooner&mdash;and anyhow, you don't
know&mdash;Of course, she couldn't have saved him
directly. But indirectly ... through another
woman&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Through another woman?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>I mean, supposing there was another woman who
loved him&mdash;one who could be to him all he needed,
who would understand, and who was all right. One
he could marry.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Roger</span></p>

<p>Yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span></p>

<p>And supposing this other woman had heard things
about Arthur, and was terribly hurt, and Arthur
knew she was, and that's why he kept away; but your
mother talked with her for a long while, and made her
understand. Even sent for <i>that</i> woman&mdash;you know.
And then this woman, the right one, did understand,
and was ready to marry Arthur....</p>

<p><i>Perron, a stout, middle-aged figure, is seated in front
of his watchmaker's establishment near the Place St.
Sulpice. The awning sags, and the shop wears an air
of sober discouragement. Whatever expression the
years have left Perron's round face capable of is concentrated
upon the changing scenes cinematographed to
his mind's eye by some strong and unusual emotion.
Alexandre, a tall, stooped man, with a flowing black tie,
bows in passing with old-fashioned punctiliousness to
Perron, who apparently is unaware of his presence.
Suddenly Perron starts, rubs his eyes, and glares about.</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Alexandre! Alexandre!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>Good day, my friend. You seem distraught.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Distraught! It was the strangest thing! But sit
here with me. Do. I have something to tell you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>I regret exceedingly, but a stupid engagement....
Later, perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>No! No! I insist! Only a great mind like yours
can explain the strange thing which has happened.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>Ah, in that case&mdash;what is a mere business affair compared
with divine philosophy? Far from being
press&eacute;, friend Perron, I have an eternity at your
service.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>First of all, tell me the exact date!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>That I can do, and not on my own authority, which
in such details is often unreliable. This morning my
concierge announced with great delicacy and feeling
that to-day is Friday, the fifteenth July, and my rent
is once more due. My rent, which&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Friday the fifteenth! Impossible!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>Alas. My concierge is of a precision the most
meticulous. For all legal, financial and military
affairs, throughout the French Republic at least, to-day
is Friday the fifteenth. But why should this
seem impossible to you, a scientist and a watchmaker?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Only listen, and you will understand why I am
tempted to doubt the calendar of the Church itself.
Two weeks ago my wife announced to me that she
had reason to expect the due arrival of a son. She
said there could be no question it will be a son because
in her mother's family for three generations it
has been the same, three daughters followed by a
son.</p>

<p>Eh bien, although I have always desired a son to follow
me in this honorable and scientific profession,
nevertheless I received the news with a certain consternation.
In short, my affairs have not gone too
well of late, and without my wife's assistance by her
needle....</p>

<p>That evening I thought much how I might increase
my funds, and so for two weeks&mdash;two weeks, mon
ami&mdash;I have omitted my customary caf&eacute; after
dejeuner, which all these years I have not failed to
take with a serious group of friends at the Trois
Arts, and even have I smoked no cigarettes. True,
this has not added much to our wealth, though it
has been some satisfaction to realize I have done my
possible. My health has suffered somewhat&mdash;I have
grown absent-minded, and in the morning my head
feels strange. However, that may not be due entirely
to my unnatural abstinence.</p>

<p>However, on Friday the fifteenth July, at three
o'clock precisely, as I sat here in meditation having
finished a small work, I saw a telegraph boy hurry
toward me down the street. Then had I a premonition.
My heart beat as it has not these twenty years.
In an instant I was reading the message: my brother,
who long ago ran away on adventure to Indo-China,
had just died and left me a fortune in tea.</p>

<p>That was on Friday the fifteenth. And do you know
what has happened since? I have lived two separate
lives. Yes, two existences have unrolled before me.
In one I saw myself as I would have been without the
telegram. My business fell away; my son was born
a daughter, to my wife's indignation and my own
dismay; and having sold my little shop I sought work
in a cursed factory. Ah me, it was terrible! But
the other picture. With my brother's fortune I made
aggrandisements and eventually moved to the Rue de
la Paix. My scientific genius was at last appreciated,
and my watches and clocks became the pride
of the haute monde. My son grew into a fine man,
much resembling myself, and after learning the profession
opened a branch office at Buenos Ayres. I
won the ribbon. In short, nothing lacked to make
life agreeable and meritorious.</p>

<p>But then it was, just at that point, I came to myself
and looking up recognized my friend the philosopher.
Years seemed to have passed&mdash;two separate life
times&mdash;and startled at finding myself seated in the
same chair and wearing the same clothes, I demanded
of you what day it was. And you answered Friday
the fifteenth. How can such a thing be possible?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>To think that you, a watchmaker and a petit bourgeois,
should experience what many a saint has died
without realizing! I salute you, mystic, descendent
of prophets and seers!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>But what was it then?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>What was it? A mystical experience, an experience
of the highest order, like unto Saint Therese, though
in symbols of mundane things. But that is the fault
of the age more than yourself. With more practise
your mind will exhibit even greater power. You
must continue in the path. Who knows what you
could do after years of self-denial, when a mere two
weeks without cigarettes have brought you this
vision?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>And without coffee. Don't forget the caf&eacute;! And
now that I am rich I shall never go without it again.
No, on the contrary, I shall have at least two, and
on a silver tray.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say you really believe?&mdash;But it
doesn't matter. Whether or not the telegram came,
the important fact is that you had the vision. It
is for this you must be grateful.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Can a philosopher really be such a fool? Of course
the telegram came! And I am grateful!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>No. You are the most ungrateful of men. But why
mention the telegram? What matters is whether your
vision arose from seeing the telegram or seeing the
telegraph boy? The philosophic truth is the same.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Mon dieu! What difference does it make? But I
swear I have the telegram, and it reads just as I
told you!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>But no! You are ungrateful, and for that I despise
you!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>But yes! And after reading it four times I locked
it in my safe. Do I not <i>know</i> I entered my shop and
locked it up?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>Yes, and do you not know also that you moved to
the Rue de la Paix?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>Oh! Could it have been&mdash;Then I am ruined, and my
brother is the most selfish of men!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>But it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. In the path
shall you grow steadfast and contented.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Perron</span></p>

<p>It doesn't matter!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alexandre</span></p>

<p>Not at all. And when you have become reasonable
and grateful, I shall return and speak further with
you. I shall devise for you such sacrifice as shall
make the saints but as little children. Au revoir.</p>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>I'm going out for a minute.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>I wish....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Harold</span></p>

<p>Once on a time!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes. Once there was a little girl who lived in the
country.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Harold</span></p>

<p>What country?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>A country something like this. She and her mother
lived in a little house beside a brook. The little girl
loved to listen to the brook outside her window at
night. One day she asked her mother where the
brook went to. She didn't want <i>her</i> brook to run
away. And what do you suppose her mother said?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Harold</span></p>

<p>What her mother say?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>She said the brook didn't really run away, when it
got out of sight across the fields it turned into rain.
So then the little girl was glad whenever it rained,
because she knew it was the little brook coming back
to her.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Harold</span></p>

<p>Oh. And is <i>this</i> rain the brook coming back? The
little girl's brook?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>The little girl grew up and went away. But it's <i>some</i>
little girl's brook. (<i>Walter comes in with sticks</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>I thought we'd have a fire.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Good! Make a big one.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Now, Harold, mother is going to put you in a nice
bed, right under the roof where the rain-drops whisper
and sing. (<i>She takes Harold out</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Where'd father go?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>He said he wanted a cigar.</p>

<p>He's been a long time.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Perhaps he's gone to look at the engine.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Walter, what's the matter with them? Last
night....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

it.</p>

<p>I don't either. I&mdash;(<i>Mrs. Everitt enters</i>)</p>

<p>Did he go to sleep?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>No. He is talking to the rain. I never heard him

<p>But Alice, there's nothing to tell. I do feel a little
tired, but then, I shall be all right in the morning.</p>

<p>I wish&mdash;(<i>Walter enters with more wood</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Well, Alice, are you still thinking about that dance?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Why no, I'd forgotten all about it. Who could
dance in such a rain? It would make the music seem
artificial. I'm getting tired of boys, too. They
don't really <i>feel</i> things&mdash;like rain, and fire.</p>

<p>What's that noise,&mdash;Harold?</p>

<p>No. It's the men in the bar room.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>I'm sure it's Harold.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>I'll go see. (<i>She goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Mother.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>What, Walter?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>I must be an awful coward&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Why, what do you mean?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>I mean that when I really want something, and ought
to say so, I go along without saying it. I don't mean
that I'm <i>really</i> afraid to say it, but I always feel
somehow that other people ought to know what I
want, and save me the trouble of asking it. No, not
<i>trouble</i> exactly&mdash;but you know what I mean.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes, Walter, I'm afraid I know exactly what you
mean. Lots of us are cursed with the same instinct.
I am, and sometimes I believe your father is, too. It
ought to be that when one sees a thing clearly in his
own mind, and knows it is best, others&mdash;at least those
near to him&mdash;should somehow be aware of it. But
they usually are not.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>No. And it's those nearest one that it's hardest to
say things to. But to-night, somehow, I don't feel
that way.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Tell me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>It's this architecture. You remember when I used
to play with water colors all the while, and say I
was going to be an artist?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Father always said I would get over it. But when
I didn't, then it occurred to him that if I learned
architecture I could help him in his building.... I
thought architecture would be the same. But it isn't.
I can't see any art in it at all&mdash;it's nothing but engineering.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>But Walter, you haven't gone far enough in it. The
art will come later.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>No it won't! At least not with father. He never
builds anything that lets me <i>imagine</i>. You don't
know how I hate those blue prints. I've been worrying
along so far because I didn't want to disappoint
father, though every day I hoped he would see what
I really felt. But to-night I know I can't go on any
longer without having it out. If he will let me follow
my own idea he will be better pleased in the end
than if I stick at this business of his. It will require
one good fight, and then I shall be free to show what
I can do.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>But Walter, what is it exactly you want to do?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span>.</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to say that I want to be an artist
rather than a builder's draughtsman, but that isn't
really it. I mean that behind the brain I think with
every day there is another brain, bigger and wiser,
that keeps asking the chance to show the rest of me
what and how to act. In ordinary things the everyday
mind gets along by itself all right, but I feel the
other self there all the while, wanting me to begin
something different, something to let it escape from
dreaming to doing. And it keeps threatening that
some day it will he too late. Only begin, begin!...
Yes, I have worried along so far, but just to-night,
for some reason or other, I seem to be standing on
the brink. I won't go another step. It's in the rain
now&mdash;I hear it. Oh, the pictures I could paint if
we lived in the country!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>In the country!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Yes. It comes over me here how much these hills
mean. Oh! and there's another thing, mother....
I thought I was born in New York, I thought we
always lived there, but just a while ago I ran onto
your old family Bible, and it had the records in it.
I&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Oh, Walter!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>It seems queer that neither of you said anything
about it, if I was really born in this very town....
I might never have thought much about it, but to-night
everything seems to be stirred up. Tell me,
mother&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>We lived here only a little while. We didn't like it,
so your father sold his farm and we went away to
New York.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Yes, but why wasn't something said about it when
we came here this afternoon? It seems funny, not to.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Dear, there was a little family trouble, long ago,
which is best forgotten.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span> (<i>entering</i>)</p>

<p>It wasn't Harold, after all, but I just had to stay
and listen to him. He tried over and over to tell
me something. I couldn't make out what it was until
he showed me with his hands&mdash;you know that funny
little way he has&mdash;and what do you suppose it was?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>The dear child. What was it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Why, he remembered the big drum he saw once in a
parade, and he was trying to explain that he was
<i>inside</i> a drum. The rain, you know.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span> (<i>entering</i>)</p>

<p>We had to jack up the car. The barn is flooding
with water.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Is that where you were?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes.... How strange you look in that light, Alice!
I never saw you look like that before. (<i>He kisses
her</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>What is it, Alice?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Why ... I thought his cigar was going to burn me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Alice, you jumped because you didn't like my breath.
I'm sorry, I did take a drink, and I shouldn't have
kissed you, only....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Only what?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>She looked just as Mary did when I first knew her.
It startled me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Do I?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Was I like that?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Of course you were.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Oh, I'm glad!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Thank you, dear, but you're not half so glad as I am.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>It's queer, there used to be a fine old stock up in
this country. It seems to have died out. The people
here don't half appreciate the place.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>But you haven't seen many of them, have you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>No, I talked with some in the bar room.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Oh, the bar room?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes, I know. One can't judge from that. A filthy
place&mdash;it made me ashamed of drinking. I only went
in hoping to see some of the people I used to know.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Where's my portfolio?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>In the office, with those hand bags we decided not to
open.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>I'm going to get it. I just had an idea.... (<i>He
goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>It's only ten o'clock, but it seems like midnight.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>So it does. Are we going on to-morrow? Will the
car be all right?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>George says so. To-morrow? I suppose so.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Well, I'm going to bed.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>I hope Harold is asleep. Good night, dear.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Good night, Mary.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>You said "Mary."</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Did I? Well, you might be, for all that.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span> (<i>leaving</i>)</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>If she had on that blue dress you used to wear, your
own mother couldn't tell you apart.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Charles.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Walter knows he was born here. He wants to know
why we didn't mention it to-day.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>So do I! So do I want to know why we didn't mention
it! It's been between us all these years!
(<i>Walter enters with his portfolio. He stands unnoticed
at the door</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>You want to know? You know very well yourself!
It's I who ought to ask what the matter is!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>You? Good heavens! Wasn't it you who suddenly
made up your mind we had to leave this town, and
insisted and insisted until I sold the house? Didn't
I do that to please you, because you went into hysterics
about it, and I had to think of Walter? I
didn't want to go. It isn't every man who would
change his whole life for a woman's unreasonable
whim!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Whim! It isn't every wife who&mdash;Oh! Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes whim! And haven't I stayed away all these years
from my people because you wouldn't hear to our
coming back even for a visit?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>No you didn't stay away! You sneaked up here
the very next year when you made that trip to Boston.
And you can't deny it, because Janet Richardson
wrote me.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Sneaked up here! Deny it! Are you mad? The
only reason I didn't mention it was because I never
understood your positive hatred for the place. What
harm was there in coming back for a day or two?
On every other subject you are all right, but whenever
we get within a mile of mentioning this town I
feel your hysteria, so I have kept still. But if there's
anything you can say to explain yourself, for goodness
sake say it! This nightmare has been between
us long enough.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes, it has! Too long! And I like your way of saying
you had to think of Walter! It was I had to
think of my baby! If it hadn't been for Walter, I
wouldn't have lived with you another day! I kept
on at first so that he might be born with a father to
look out for him, and then I kept on so that he
needn't grow up in the shame of a divorce. But oh,
the pain of it! To keep silent, year after year!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Look here, are we both crazy? Out with it!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p><i>Annie Pratt!</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>What? Who?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Annie Pratt!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Who the devil's Annie Pratt? What's she got to do
with it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Ha! Not faithful even to her! Or are you trying
to lie out of it? You can't, <i>because I've still got the
letter</i>.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>What letter? I'm not going to stand these hysterics
any longer!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>You needn't. But you've got to stand the truth,
do you hear me? I found the letter in your pocket.
We hadn't been married a year. I was so happy!
Oh! Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>So was I happy, Oh! Oh!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Hypocrite! "Dearest Charlie: You said it is I who
am your wife really, because it's I who make you
happy." Vile cat!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Annie Pratt, Annie Pratt. I remember her....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>I should think you would! But any man who will&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Look here! I've got the whole thing! You found
that letter in my pocket?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes I did.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Well, do you remember my quarrel with Charlie
Fisher?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes. Why?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Because, you poor child, that letter was written to
him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>To him!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Yes, Charlie Fisher. I found that he was going with
Annie Pratt and I had it out with him one day in the
barn. I told him if he didn't quit his foolishness I'd
tell his people. We nearly came to blows&mdash;he was
drinking too much, too&mdash;and I found that letter on
the floor afterwards. I meant to burn it up, but I
forgot it. And you thought I was the Charlie!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>God forgive me!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>But why on earth didn't you come right out with it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Oh! You can't realize how crushed I felt. I wanted
only to run away, like a wounded animal.... And
then I couldn't bear to quarrel, for the sake of Walter.
So it's been festering in me all this time.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>So that's it. Well, thank heaven! (<i>He starts to
embrace her</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>But that letter you picked up so quickly to-night&mdash;was
that from somebody else?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Lord, I'd almost forgotten it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>There! And I was almost happy!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>For goodness sake, read it!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>From your bank.... I don't understand it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>It's simple enough. They won't make me another
loan.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Between the unions and the new inspection&mdash;well, I
can't finish the Broadway contract on time, and I'm
done.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Done?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Done. Smashed. I might save ten thousand dollars,
that's all. My life's work....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>You mean money?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>I mean the lack of it.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Is that all? Thank heaven!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>All! But do you realize it means giving up the
house, and beginning all over again on ten thousand
dollars?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>I don't care. I was never happy there anyhow. And
now I could be happy doing my own work in a tenement.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>I think I could be happy as a carpenter again by
the day. But the children. It's going to be hard for
them. Walter's architecture.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>Father!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Good gracious! Where did you come from?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>I came back from the office.... I heard what you
were saying. So that's all right. But you needn't
worry about my architecture. I was telling mother
to-night. I don't like it&mdash;it isn't my work. I only
wanted you to feel as I do about it. Just feel that
I really want to paint&mdash;to be an artist. Even if I
have to work at something else for a long time, I'll
feel easier, knowing you realize what I want. I love
color so. And I want to let my imagination <i>go</i>. I'll
help in any way I can, naturally. I'm glad too. I
mean, I had rather live in the country like this than
in New York.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Good Lord! (<i>Alice appears in the doorway holding
Harold</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>It seems to me that none of us has been really satisfied,
so it isn't so bad after all. We can begin on
something real to us all. Mother said she would be
happy in a tenement. Well, maybe she would, but
why not come up here?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Oh, <i>Charles</i>!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>Well ... but Alice.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Mother.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>You, too! What is it? What's the matter with
Harold?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Nothing. He wouldn't go to sleep, and wouldn't.
He said he wanted to sit in your lap. I never saw
him so. I had to bring him.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Give him to me, dear.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>And I knew something was going on down here...
I could <i>feel</i> it. I don't know what it was, but there's
one thing I do know.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Why, ever since father said I looked as you used to
I've been thinking about what you must have been
like as a girl, and it came over me how <i>useless</i> I am.
I've never done anything. And you must have done
a lot.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>I should say she did!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Walter</span></p>

<p>There! Say, Alice, how'd you like to live in that
white house we passed, the one with the orchard?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>Really? And <i>do</i> things?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Everitt</span></p>

<p>Charles!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Everitt</span></p>

<p>This is the most extraordinary night I ever heard of.
Here I was, feeling like a condemned criminal because
I'd lost my business, afraid to tell Mary and you
children, and now you all seem positively glad of it.
I expected all kinds of trouble, and all at once....
<i>What the deuce is it?</i></p>

<p>Delightful! How I love the atmosphere of work in a
studio! I used to paint a bit myself, you know.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Did you? Father never mentioned that.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Oh, I guess everybody has forgotten it by now. An
early adventure with life! Goodness only knows what
might have happened, though, if the business hadn't
fallen on me to look out for. I might have been a
great artist. Ha!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>I'm sure you would, Mr. Wentworth. You've always
been interested in art, haven't you?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Yes indeed. Of course I have been very busy, until
lately. But I always followed the best English
magazines.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>My husband's upstairs getting the paint off his
hands. He will be down in a minute. Then we'll
have some tea.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>You don't paint, do you, Silvia? I may call you
Silvia, may I not?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Of course. No, I don't paint. I just fly around
amongst the artists and see what's going on. Are
you staying in Paris very long?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>A couple of weeks more, at least. I am revelling in
the galleries and museums here.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Here comes Joe. Joe, I want you to meet my cousin,
Mr. Wentworth. Mr. Wentworth&mdash;Mr. Carson.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Very glad to meet you, Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>It's a great pleasure for me to meet a real artist,
Mr. Carson.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Excuse me a moment. I'll bring on the tea.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Oh, as for that&mdash;I'm working along. Sometimes I
hit it&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p><i>Ars longa, vita brevis</i> you know! I want to see your
pictures very much. I was just telling Silvia how I
delight in the Louvre. I go there with a class for
lectures every morning. I suppose you often copy
the old masters?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Copy the old masters? I should say not. I'm not
out to be a camera. It's all I can do to work out my
own impressions.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Oh, I see. But&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>The tea's ready. Joe, bring up that chair for Mr.
Wentworth. Mr. Wentworth, do you take cream
and sugar?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span>
If you please. Yes, two lumps. There's nothing like
the atmosphere of a studio, is there? I love it. I
feel I have missed so much. Still, the instinct for
beauty, fragile as it is, does persist.... I was surprised
to feel so many of my old emotions awake on
coming to Paris. So much that hasn't been real to
me for years! I have gained much inspiration for
planning my new house.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>You are building a new house? I have heard father
talk about your collection of Japanese prints.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>A really delightful thing, Japanese prints. Yes, I
intend building on Long Island. And my new interest
in pictures ... I shall have a gallery especially
for them.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Americans haven't done any too much for art so far.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Oh, I assure you! I know many men who are continually
buying the best on the market.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Oh, <i>that</i>....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Another cup, Mr. Wentworth? Joe, pass the cake.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>No, thank you, Silvia. Yes, the cake if you please.
Why, it's real English plumcake!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>English things are getting very popular over here.
Joe, won't you show us the new picture? He finished
it just before you came, Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Indeed! I should like to see it very much.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>There isn't very much light.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>No, the light is poor. But even so&mdash;and your colors
will stand out, Joe.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Really, Mr. Carson, I counted on seeing some of your
work. I have heard, nice things about you.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>There. If you stand just here....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Oh, <i>Joe</i>!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>It's our little cottage! I'm so glad! That's where
we lived last summer, Mr. Wentworth. I always
wanted Joe to paint it. Joe, it's splendid! Don't
you think so, Mr. Wentworth?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Yes.... Yes. <i>Very</i> interesting....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Don't you love the bright colors and the firm, flowing
lines?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Of course, it isn't exactly what I have been accustomed
to.... I have heard that some of the younger
Frenchmen and Russians are painting in a new
way, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Joe, it's so <i>alive</i>! I <i>feel</i> it, every inch of it! You've
no idea, Mr. Wentworth, how Joe's painting has
changed me. I used to be such a little New Englander,
<i>afraid</i> of life, but now&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>It isn't only what you call the "younger Frenchmen
and Russians" who are learning how to paint&mdash;the
modern movement has spread all over.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Of course, I don't pretend to be an artist myself, but
I have always studied and loved pictures, and when
you say "learning <i>how</i> to paint"&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>That's exactly what it is. Learning <i>how</i> to paint.
Learning what art is. Getting <i>life</i> into it instead of
abstract ideas.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Art? But art is beauty! Eternal beauty. You
can't change art over night, like a fashion!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>But that picture's beautiful!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Art changes as life changes. Art has always
changed. If it didn't, why isn't your Japanese art
just like Greek art? And Greek art like the Italian?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Oh, in that way, of course. But all the great masters
obey the eternal laws of beauty!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>There aren't any eternal <i>laws</i> of beauty! There's
only the eternal impulse to create. Every artist has
to express himself in his own way. What you call
the "eternal laws" are merely the particular expressions
your own favorite painters happened to work
out in their time. If they had lived in another time&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>A master would always be a master. There's no
change possible in the vision of the soul.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>You see, Mr. Wentworth, what I have learned these
last two years from living among artists is that the
painter with an original vision is always opposed by
the schools. That is, at first. But when he wins
out, then the schools merely take over his technic
and use it as a club to put down the next creator.
And so it goes.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Naturally, the great artist suffers hardship. But if
we once admit there are no <i>laws</i>, where are we?
Anarchy!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>The laws are contained in the impulses themselves.
They come <i>with</i> the vision, not before it! If any
one thinks this modern art is just an easy way of
painting&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Indeed it isn't! Joe works much harder than the
students who go to the schools. Of course, he doesn't
paint by the clock.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>But the Louvre! All those beautiful pictures, those
priceless treasures! What about the Louvre?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>The Louvre? It's a <i>museum</i>.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>What do you mean by "it's a <i>museum</i>"?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>I mean that it's the place to put pictures in when
they are dead.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p><i>Dead?</i> A great masterpiece <i>dead</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Of course. No man lives forever. Nobody that was
ever born was useful enough to live forever. The
bigger a man is the longer his influence is creative, in
art and everything else, but the time always comes
when his value is spent. When the world needs a
new influence.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>It's really wonderful, Mr. Wentworth, how knowing
the truth about art shows one the truth about
other things. When I remember what I used to believe!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>But see here, young man, you wouldn't do away with
the <i>Louvre</i>, would you? Why, what would happen
if these ideas were carried out....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>No, I wouldn't do away with it. Why should I? If
to burn it down would wake people up to <i>life</i>, I'd do
it in a minute. But it wouldn't. They would only
sanctify the superstition and make it immortal. No,
leave the Louvre as it is. It's really quite useful.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>But good gracious! <i>Useful?</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Yes. Like history. To do away with the Louvre
would be to destroy a part of history. There's no
good doing that. We need history&mdash;it cranks up
life&mdash;but we've got to recognize that after all it is
only history, not life itself&mdash;not art.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>But what <i>is</i> art, if the Louvre <i>isn't</i>?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Don't you see, Mr. Wentworth? If you could only
get for a moment into the stream of experience where
Joe and the others brought me! A picture is art as
long as it's alive&mdash;as long as it can give back the
fresh, first-hand impulses that were put into it. After
that&mdash;when life has flowed on and set up new impulses
requiring a different expression&mdash;then a picture
drops back upon a lower level. What Joe calls
<i>history</i>.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Like everything else.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>But you put art on the same plane as invention. An
improved motor car scraps the old model. But you
can't <i>improve</i> art!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>No, certainly not. We don't try to. We just do
our best. We <i>recover</i> art.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p><i>Recover</i> it?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;discover it all over again. It gets lost, lost in
hard and fast rules or sentimentality, then a genius
comes along and digs down to the buried city&mdash;creation.
Art isn't like invention. It's more like religion.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>There you are!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>There we are! Isn't there a struggle going on all the
time to free religion, the <i>spirit</i> of religion, from hard
and fast rules and from false emotions? It's exactly
the same thing.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Ah, but rules are necessary to maintain order. That's
what I insist about art. We <i>must</i> have rules!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>I know exactly what you mean, Mr. Wentworth. You
mean that if fanatics tore down all the churches on
the street corners, and there weren't any more Sunday
morning sermons, everybody would run wild.
But there again it's the same thing as with art: the
man who has the spirit of the thing in him feels that
the spirit itself is a far better control than heaps of
stones and sermons. It's all a matter of <i>living</i>.
Imagine asking one of the Apostles which church he
went to!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Wait! We are getting art mixed up with too much
else. Didn't you say, Mr. Carson, that pictures died
when they no longer gave out impulses of beauty?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Well! I admit there are dead pictures, too many
of them, but they are the canvasses that were still-born.
The masterpieces in the Louvre <i>still</i> give out
impulses&mdash;beautiful impulses&mdash;to many of us, thank
heaven!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>But that's just it! The impulses you mean aren't
those of art at all. They&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Those pictures don't give out impulses to the <i>artist</i>.
The impulses they do give out are only the emotions
that satisfy the student who has learned some rules
and then sees the rules worked out. The artist produced
the rules as a side issue, but you are trying to
make the rules produce the artist. That's the difficulty
when people as a whole lose the creative sense.
They are satisfied with things at second-hand. Second-hand
expressions of life, and second-hand philosophies
to justify the expressions. It's a kind of
conspiracy in which everybody works against everybody
else. Only the few real artists in any generation
break through it into the light.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>The light of the sun!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>I fear we are hopelessly at odds in this question.
Well, as the Romans said, there's no disputing about
tastes. Every one to his own taste.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>No!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>I mean that it's a disgrace that Americans only study
and only buy old masters. It's a burning shame that
all they know about art is what they have been taught
in books. They let their own artists starve&mdash;they
make them come over here&mdash;while they bid up a
Raphael like a block of shares. What good does it
do Raphael? He had his day. And look how it holds
back our own possible Raphaels!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Raphael? Ah, you are still very young. You don't
understand the attitude of the majority, Mr. Carson.
Raphael is one of our great inspirers of beauty.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>You mean culture!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Oh, it's getting quite dark. Joe, light the light.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Dear me, so it is! What time is it? It must be getting
late&mdash;Good gracious! I have an engagement.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>You can't stay for a little dinner with us in the Quarter,
Mr. Wentworth? Afterward we could go to one
of the caf&eacute;s.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I can't, Silvia. It's been a great pleasure
to meet you both, I assure you. These little differences
of opinion....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Oh, that's all right. We argue art and religion every
day, don't we, Joe? Of course, though, we <i>do</i> feel
strongly about the young artists&mdash;the young American
artists. They come over here, and then they
have to burn their bridges ... and we see how wonderful
America could be if they were given things to
do instead of being neglected....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Here's your coat, Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wentworth</span></p>

<p>Thank you. Thank you for the delicious tea, Silvia.
If I weren't leaving town so soon.... Good night.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Good night. The stairs are rather dark.... (<i>He
goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Damn!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span></p>

<p>Yes, I know, Joe. It's discouraging....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Discouraging? It's immoral! Oh, these smug people
who have been taught what to admire! These
unborn souls who want to shut us all up in the dark!
I suppose he went away thinking I put myself up
higher than Raphael. Who are we painting for?
<i>They</i> don't want it&mdash;wouldn't take it for a gift. And
here we are, a poor little group, standing amazed
before the glory of the sun, and painting it&mdash;for the
blind!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Some day, Joe....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Some day&mdash;yes, when the life has oozed out of all our
bright canvasses, when only the "rules" are left. And
we won't be able to rise from our graves and curse
them!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>Now, Joe!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>I guess I let you in for a hard time, Silvia. I wish
sometimes I could really paint the kind of thing that
goes with stupid people's dining rooms. They with
their <i>Long Island</i> Louvres!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Silvia</span></p>

<p>If you did, Joe, I'd put it in the stove. Don't think
you are having all the fun of being a pioneer. It's
exciting to be within a mile of it!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Joe</span></p>

<p>Good girl. Ugh! Let's go to Boudet's and have
dinner. I want to get the bad taste out of my
mouth!</p>

<p>But Jean, where are you going, when you pack up
here?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>I'm not leaving here. I'm staying on.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>If I have any work to do, I can do it here. You
don't understand, quite. All these years I have been
living from whirlpool to whirlpool, never settled,
always <i>deracin&eacute;</i>&mdash;the thought of getting accustomed
to another place makes me shudder.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>I can imagine, now, how it has been, Jean. But can
you find any peace here? With all these things
about? You are so sensitive&mdash;lamps, and pictures,
and rugs&mdash;these aren't just <i>furniture</i> to you, they
are images of the past. Won't they be, too&mdash;real?
Too personal? Won't you feel more at liberty with
yourself if you create your own atmosphere?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>Ah, they are real enough! That table is a winter in
Munich; the samovar is Warsaw one night in May;
the lucerna is Rome ... and all that those places
mean to me. I never realized how <i>things</i> could be
<i>alive</i>&mdash;be personal&mdash;until I was left all alone in the
midst of these.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>There, don't you see? They're so <i>dominating</i>. I
knew you before all this.... I wish you would get

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>No. I shall stay here. As close as possible.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>But really, Jean! I'm thinking of your work. Perhaps
you don't appreciate what an insidious drug
memory can be. Especially the memory of unhappiness.
Let's be frank, Jean, for the sake of your
future. You <i>have</i> been unhappy.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

Years of it! Sharp arrows and poisoned wine. I

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>We had the deepest respect and admiration for one
another, but somehow we never walked in step. His
emotion repressed mine, my emotion repressed his.
Sometimes one was the slave, sometimes the other.
We couldn't both be free at the same time. There
was always something to hide, to be afraid of....
Not words nor acts, but moods. It passed over from
one soul to the other like invisible rays. And we
couldn't separate. That was part of it. We just
went on and on....</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>People wondered. The first time I met Paul&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>What do you feel?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>I wondered, afterward, what it really was. He
seemed to impress me like a powerful motor car
stalled in a muddy road.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>Ah. I know!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>Poor child.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>No. You don't understand, I <i>was</i> unhappy, in the
ordinary sense, unbelievably so. But that wasn't
all. I was alive! I lived as the man lives who faints
in the dark mine underground, and I lived as the
aviator lives, thrilling against the sun, and as the
believer in a world of infidels. That was what <i>he</i>
did for me. And slowly, as I learned how deeply
the very pain was making me live, I put my unhappiness
by. It was there, but it no longer seemed important.
It was the lingering complaint of my old
commonplace soul standing fearfully on the brink of
greater things and hating the situation that led it
there.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>You are a big woman, Jean.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>No, I am a small woman in front of a big thing.
One of the biggest, genius. And the force of it, relentless
as nature, made me what I am. <i>Paul.</i> Oh,
Vera, when I think of his music, tempestuous as the
sea, healing as spring.... And now where is it?
He had what all the world wants most, <i>flight</i>, and
the world stalled him in its own mud. You saw it....
That's why I shall stay here. It's the only
place with <i>his</i> atmosphere. All these things are <i>he</i>.
I face them here in silence, and I bare my breast to
the arrow. Here I am, the only one who knows Paul's
music in its possibility. To the rest, it is a heap of
stones by the roadside. The architect is dead.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>But didn't he ever ... why didn't he...?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>You ask it, of course. You have the right. Sometimes
I ask it, too, why Paul never <i>succeeded</i>. While
we were struggling along, the things that held him
back seemed only details. Only now do I see them
as a whole.</p>

<p>In the first place, Paul never aimed directly at success.
He was all-round. If it had been merely a
question of exploiting his talent, sticking to the one
idea day in, day out, never letting an opportunity
slip by of meeting the right people and getting to
the right places ... that would have been easy.
He had tremendous energy. I used to grudge his
interest in other things. I hated to see him lose the
chances and let them be snapped up by littler men.
He seemed to waste himself, right and left, prodigally.
But it wasn't that, it wasn't waste. It was
all as much a part of him as his music. He detested
the stupidity of wealth and poverty, he rebelled
against laws that aren't laws, but only interests enforced
by authority, he fought against the sheer
deadness of prejudice. How he hated all that! And
why not? You see, Vera, he was sensitive to it not
only as a thinker, but as a musician, too. It was all
a part of the discord, and what I used to think his
wasting himself was really an effort to create a
larger harmony. He used to say that the beauty of
music is only the image of beauty in life, and that
life must come first. He couldn't endure discords
anywhere. Paul despised the musicians who scream
at a flatted <i>f</i> but hunger for the flesh pots after the
performance. No, he was never <i>that</i>. And people
resented it. The very people who ought to have
understood.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>But he didn't neglect his music, that is...?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>No. He made enormous efforts to get his violin before
the public. And several times he was "discovered"
by men who could have made him famous overnight.
We all believe that genius will out, despite
anything, but it doesn't always. Musicians respected
him, but they were afraid of him, too. He
criticized them for their shortcomings in other
things, just as he criticized others for their shortcomings
in art. He wouldn't accept any talent, no
matter how fine, if it went with anything small or
destructive. You can imagine the china shops he
left in fragments! Just think! Once in Berlin it
was all arranged for him to have a recital&mdash;he was
working furiously on his program and I was dancing
on air&mdash;when just at the last moment he heard the
director make some light remark or other about
women. Paul was raging! He threw the words back
in the fellow's teeth, and made him apologize, but
there we were. They called off the recital, naturally.
And I couldn't blame Paul. I was just beginning
to understand. Another time ... no, he never had
luck. Paul had bad luck. I often think of the Greek
tragedies.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>Another time?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>Another time&mdash;it was in Warsaw&mdash;we had gone with
a letter of introduction to Sbarovitch&mdash;</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span>
<i>The</i> Sbarovitch?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>Yes. It was a chance in ten thousand. We pawned
stuff to get there. Well, Paul played like a god.
Sbarovitch was quite overcome. He swore he would
compose something especially for Paul. We had
visions of playing before the Czar.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>But what happened?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>What happened? One night a woman called on Paul
at the hotel. He went down, not knowing who it
was or anything about her. He said afterward that
she started in flattering him and asking him to play
for her some time.... Then Sbarovitch rushed in,
seizing the woman and cursing Paul with mouthfuls
of Slavic hate. So <i>that</i> dream ended!</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>But why? Was it Sbarovitch's wife?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>No, worse luck&mdash;it was his mistress. Ah, you can't
imagine the re-action from such disappointments!
The long, slow warming to the full possibility of the
occasion, until the artist's mind and body become
one leaping flame&mdash;and then the sudden fall into icy
water. It takes months to work up to the same pitch
again.... And then Rome.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>What, again?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes. Again. This time&mdash;for a wonder everything
went smoothly. I had watched over him like
a cat, to save him from others' stupidity and his own
impetuousness. It came the very moment when he
had to go to the theatre. He asked me if I were
ready, I wasn't. <i>I didn't want to go.</i></p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>You didn't want to go?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>No. It's difficult to explain, but somehow by then
I had grown aware that the long series of little obstacles,
each one accidental and temporary, seemed
to express something unseen, something impersonal,
a kind of fate ... as if the verdict had gone forth
from the lords of things that Paul was <i>not</i> to succeed.
And everything seemed to hang in the balance
that night. I thought that the fact I was aware of
Paul's bad luck made me all the likelier instrument
for it to work through. So I told him I had a headache....
He must have felt something in my voice.
He dropped his violin and demanded I tell him why
I didn't <i>want</i> to go. His intuition told him it was a
matter of will with me. I hadn't thought to have a
story ready. Besides, I was so worn out that I was
on the verge of hysteria. He stormed, and I sat
staring at him without a word, wondering only why
he didn't forget poor insignificant me and go forth
to his glory. I despised him for considering me at
such a moment. I didn't understand. <i>My</i> opinion,
<i>my</i> feeling, was more important to Paul than the
rest of the world. So, after all, I <i>was</i> the instrument.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>But why didn't you just get up and go?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>As soon as I saw how much it meant to Paul, I tried
to. But it was too late.... We sat there arguing
until three in the morning. An orgy of tears and
self-immolation for us both.... I suppose he might
have explained to the director afterward and arranged
another concert, but those things are never
the same the second time. Well, I forced myself to
get rid of that feeling about his bad luck. How I
ever succeeded I don't know, for Paul caught my
mood and began to believe it himself. But somehow
I did. And then I made him give up his violin and
begin composing. Of course we had to have money
for that. I wrote a relative and demanded, point
blank, shamelessly, two thousand dollars. I felt it
was my restitution to Paul. I received the money.
What the relative thought, I don't know. I suppose
he paid it to avoid getting another such letter from
me. I don't blame him.</p>

<p>So we came over here and Paul started at work. I
was fighting for him and with him every moment.
How he worked! Six months, like a coal heaver.
Then he finished and played it over. He tore it all
up. Every note.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>He said it was written in an old-fashioned style. It
was curious&mdash;in his playing he appreciated the most
advanced technic, but when be came to compose he
found himself imitating the things he had admired
when he was eighteen. It had to be worked out of
his mind. Well, he did it all through again. This
time he said he was only about two years behind.
Tore it up again. But now he was convinced he
could succeed. And he was magnificent! I would
have shared him with the world gladly, but I knew
it was best for him to do this work. The hours this
room has seen! Well, he made a few notes, stopped
a few days to take breath, and then caught the cold
that wore him out. Over there, in that drawer, are
the notes, a few scraps of paper. The rest of it&mdash;the
experience of a strong life, a visioning life, are
with the mind that is dumb. Sometimes when I sit
here I hear it all played, an orchestra ... new harmonies,
pure emotion.... The wonder and then the
pain of it are almost unbearable.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>Ah, Jean, I begin to understand.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>Over in London there are half a dozen men and
women who caught a glimpse of Paul as he really
was. In Munich there are half a dozen more. He
was at his best in a studio among friends with a congenial
atmosphere. <i>They</i> knew... but what is
that?</p>

<p>I tell you, Vera, the only way I can explain it all is
by seeing two forces, two moralities; the morality
of God and the morality of nature. Perhaps in some
people they both work together for the same end,
but they don't always.... In the sight of heaven,
Paul was an apostle of harmony. In the sight of
nature, he was the seed too many on the tree, the
bird wrongly colored in the forest. I sit among
these things, the fast-ebbing beats of his memory,
thinking of what he might have been for others as he
was to me, and my heart breaks. Our unhappiness?
A cloud passing before the sun&mdash;nothing more. And
during this past year I have come to love him all
over again, not as mate but as mother.</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Vera</span></p>

<p>Ah, Jean, with all his bad luck, he had you! Who
knows what might have happened if you had not been
there?</p>

<p class="character"><span class="smcap">Jean</span></p>

<p>He had <i>me</i>? No, he never had me&mdash;he <i>made</i> me....
And that's why I sit all alone with the things
that are Paul,&mdash;Paul, the flame that was never lit on
the altar, the sword that was never drawn from the
scabbard.... We talk together, Vera. Paul and
I. We talk together, and I wait for him to tell me
what to do.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
